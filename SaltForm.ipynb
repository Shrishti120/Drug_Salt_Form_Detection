Azithromycin/ml works by inhibiting the growth of the infection-causing bacteria and stopping it from multiplying. As a result of this  the spread of the infection is disabled. Azithromycin/ml is usually given once a day  preferably in the morning. However  in the case of typhoid  it is to be given twice. Give it with or without food at about the same time each day. However  it is best given with food since children often have a sensitive stomach and could easily get a stomach upset. Medicine dose depends on the type of infection your child has  its severity  and your child’s age and body weight. So stick to the dose  time  and way prescribed by the doctor. In case your child vomits within 30 minutes of taking this medicine  give the same dose again. Your child may start to feel better within 2 days of regular dosing. However  you must still complete the full prescribed course of the medicine and never stop it abruptly as that may worsen your child’s condition or increase the risk of reinfection. Some of the minor and temporary side effects of this medicine include vomiting  diarrhea  nausea  and stomach pain. Usually  these episodes subside once your child’s body adapts to the medicine. However  in case these effects persist or become bothersome for your child  consult your child’s doctor without any delay. Inform your child’s doctor about any previous episode of any allergy  heart problem  liver impairment  and kidney malfunction. Knowing the child’s medical history is critical for dose alterations and for planning your child’s overall treatment.',\n",
